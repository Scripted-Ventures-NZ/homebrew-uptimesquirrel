## Troubleshooting

### Agent not starting?

1. Check your API key is correctly set in `/usr/local/etc/uptimesquirrel/agent.conf`
2. Check logs: `tail -f /usr/local/var/log/uptimesquirrel/agent.error.log`
3. Run manually to see errors: `uptimesquirrel-agent -c /usr/local/etc/uptimesquirrel/agent.conf`

### Permission issues?

The agent needs appropriate permissions to collect system metrics. If you encounter issues:

```bash
sudo brew services restart uptimesquirrel-agent
```

### Not seeing metrics?

1. Ensure your agent is registered at [app.uptimesquirrel.com/agents](https://app.uptimesquirrel.com/agents)

3. Verify the agent is running: `ps aux | grep uptimesquirrel`
